1. when we create react element it will be in object
2. when we try to render then it will be converted as html code that browser understand
3. if the root element has already some elemnts then it will replace that one
4. what ever other than root it will remain as it is

5. we can nest the elemnts by passing it in the 3 parameter in react.createelemnt
