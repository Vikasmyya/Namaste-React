1. to build starting our project, we need to include in the package jason script section(inductries statnderd) 
    "start":"parcel index.html"
    to run cmd: npm run start / npm start and npm build not work we need to give full command for prod

2. JSX - javascripts syntax to build html element, jsx is diffrent and react diffrent
    jsx id not html in javascripts, its a html like syntax
    jsx (transpiled before it reaches js engine) - done by parcel - bable
    jax element will converted to react.createelement 
    in Html we use class as attribute but in jsx we use className an we use camel case in jsx
    if jsx is in multiple line wrap it in paranthese ()

3. React component
    class bases components(old way) and function base components(new way)
    when we trying to create a func component start with capital letter
    is a normal javascripts function which returns some jsx / javascripts function which returns react elements
    if you have multiple elements you need to wrap it around a element
    like this is component composition 
        <div>
            <h1></h1>
            <h2></h2>
        </div>
4. Inside jsx if you want to write javascripts code you can do that by inside the curly braces {}
